Description: system load monitor designed for Window Maker
 wmload displays a graphical representation of the kernel/system
 statistics on a 64x64 miniwindow. There are three shades in the
 window: the light one, which corresponds to user statistics, second
 is the nice time statistics, and the darkest one is system statistics.
 .
 It works with other window managers, there isn't anything in the program to
 make it require Window Maker, except maybe the look.
